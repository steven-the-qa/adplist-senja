# ADPList Review to Senja Testimonial Converter

This project automates the process of fetching reviews for an ADPList mentor and converting them into testimonials on Senja.

## Where to find it

Live site: https://majestic-babka-6bae67.netlify.app/

## How it works

1. Fetch all of your ADPList reviews

2. Create a testimonial on Senja for each review

## What you'll need

- Your ADPList User ID
- Your Senja API key

## Where do I get the API Key and User ID?

- Ensure you have API access on Senja before using this tool. At the time of writing this, Senja API access only comes with a [Pro plan]([url](https://senja.io/pricing)).

- Your ADPList User Id can be found in the URL when you are on your public profile page on ADPList. In the Network tab in Chrome DevTools, find a network request with  `identity_id` in the request parameters. Use the `identity_id` value as your User Id in this tool.
